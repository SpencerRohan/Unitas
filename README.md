# Unitas - A Quick JS Challenge
___
### Directions:
Please take no more than 15 minutes to answer the following with as many solutions as you can think of:
Given the number 1, the function returns the number 0. Given a number 0, the function returns the number 1.  
Format should be:
function foo(x){
  // Your code
} // Response should be an integer, 0 or 1.
There are 100s of ways to solve this, what I want to see is how many ways you can think of for solving this, relatively simple problem.  As a hint, equality isn’t the only way to solve this.
We are asking for your honesty, so please only take 15 minutes.

### Notes, Thoughts, & Challenge Feedback

Challenge took me just under 15 minutes to develop.  Spent a few minutes creating the repository and writing up this readme.

I took about 5 minutes to quickly jot ideas down on "HOW" I thought one could accomplish this. The rest of the 15 minutes I quickly harfed out code in order to make this come to life.  I looked up a couple of basic syntax for only one of the functions - I knew about the NOT operator, however wasn't sure if !0 === 1 for sure.  Luckily it did!

I thought this was a great challenge for potential hires, would definitly recommend that this type of coding challenges are sent to your potential hires in the future.  It doesn't eat up an entire day, gets to the point, and is quite fun to think about!
